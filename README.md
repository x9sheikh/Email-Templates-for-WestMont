# Email Templates for WestMont

This repository contains highly optimized HTML email templates designed to work seamlessly with platforms that have strict formatting rules, such as **PipeDrive** and **Gmail**. The templates are also compatible with other platforms that fully support HTML and CSS-based email templates.

## Purpose

These email templates are built to overcome the limitations imposed by certain email clients and platforms. While many templates work perfectly in web browsers, issues often arise when integrated into systems like Gmail or PipeDrive due to their strict handling of HTML and CSS. This repository aims to provide robust, flexible templates that maintain functionality and design integrity across all email platforms, especially those with stringent requirements.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Optimized for use with Gmail, PipeDrive, and other strict email clients.
- **Customizable**: Easily update the content and color schemes to suit your branding or message needs.
- **Best Practices**: Adheres to the best HTML and CSS practices for email development, ensuring compatibility and responsiveness.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the HTML file and modify the content, images, and color scheme as needed.
3. Ensure to test the template on the desired email client or platform before sending.
4. Upload the template to your platform (e.g., PipeDrive, Gmail, etc.).

## Requirements

To ensure the email templates function correctly across all platforms, follow these guidelines:
- Test the template on all relevant email platforms before final deployment.
- Avoid embedding unsupported CSS rules and JavaScript, which may be stripped by email clients like Gmail.
